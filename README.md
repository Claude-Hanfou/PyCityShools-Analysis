# PyCityShools-Analysis

## Observations

* Budget wise, bigger schools spend more than smaller schools on their students, this could be an indicator that students in bigger schools might have more expensive needs or there is inadequacy in budget management.In addition, we can also see that smaller schools tend to have higher overall passing rates.

* If we take a look at the school types, we see that Charter schools have a higher passing rate in both Math and Reading in comparison to District schools, and therefore a higher overall passing rate.

* Larger schools tend to have a lower scores in both reading and passing, this could be attributed to the school size and inability to manage a large number of student as it may be for a smaller schools. 


The PyCityShools-Analysis repository contains a Jupyter Notebook to analyze fictional district-wide standardized test results. The purpose of the repository is to aggregate the data and showcase obvious trends in school performance.Also,helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

### District Summary
A high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
* Total Schools
* Total Students
* Total Budget
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* % Passing Math
* % Passing Reading
* Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### School Summary
An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
* School Name
* School Type
* Total Students
* Total School Budget
* Per Student Budget
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* % Passing Math
* % Passing Reading
* Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Included are:
* School Name
* School Type
* Total Students
* Total School Budget
* Per Student Budget
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* % Passing Math
* % Passing Reading
* Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
A table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include all of the same metrics as above.
### Math Scores by Grade
* A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
### Reading Scores by Grade
* A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
### Scores by School Spending
Tables that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student) using 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Each table includes the following:
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* % Passing Math
* % Passing Reading
* Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)
### Scores by School Size
* Similar to the "Scores by School Spending" table, but in this table the schools are grouped based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

### Scores by School Type
* Similar to the "Scores by School Size" table, but in this table, schools are grouped based on school type (Charter vs. District).
